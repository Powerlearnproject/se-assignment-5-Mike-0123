2. **Select "New File" or "New Folder."**
3. **Type a name:** Enter the desired name for your file or folder and press Enter.

**Opening Files:**
1. **Double-click:** In the Explorer view, double-click on a file to open it for editing in the main editor area.
**Navigating Efficiently:**
* **Explorer View:** Browse your project's file structure visually. Expand and collapse folders to find what you need.
* **Search Bar:** Type the name of a file or folder to quickly locate it within your project.
* **Open Recent:** Click the "File" menu (top left) and go to "Open Recent" to access recently opened files.
* **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Use shortcuts like `Ctrl+T` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+T` (Mac) to open a new file and `Ctrl+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+P` (Mac) to open a specific file.

**Shortcuts for Faster Access (Bonus!):**

While VS Code doesn't have built-in bookmarking like a web browser, you can create shortcuts for frequently used files or folders:

1. **Open the file or folder.**
2. **Pin to Favorites:** Right-click on the file/folder tab in the editor area and select "Pin to Favorites." This keeps the tab open even when you close other files.
